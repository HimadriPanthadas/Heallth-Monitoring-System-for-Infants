# Infant Health Monitoring System

## Overview
The Infant Health Monitoring System is designed to simultaneously track the temperature and heart rate of infants, providing real-time monitoring of these critical health parameters. Building a reliable device for this purpose poses several challenges, as it requires the integration of multiple sensors and components while maintaining accurate and dependable performance. Considerations such as power consumption, sensor accuracy, signal conditioning, and data processing algorithms are crucial to its design. Additionally, a balance between size, cost, and reliability must be achieved to meet clinical standards. Regulatory compliance and selecting the most suitable sensors and signal processing algorithms further complicate the development process.
